# Cross product explained

<p style="font-size:16px">
During one of my games concepts lectures there was a general confusion about what is happening in it. So I am going to have a brief cover over it.<br>
</p>

<p style="font-size:14px">
This is my first time doing anything like this so sorry if the quality isn't amazing.
</p>

<p style="font-size:18px">
In this first video I am briefly covering what the cross product is and how I'd start to write it out:
</p>

<p style="font-size:16px">
The idea here is to put the two vectors into a form that easy to see and understand. <br><br>Two vectors here <em>V and W</em> each with their own x, y and z co-ordinate, we're going to find the <em>VxW</em>, remember this is <strong>different</strong> to <em>WxV</em>. Where I have put them in the following form
</p>

<table style="width:20%">
  <tr>
    <th>X</th>
    <th>Y</th>
    <th>Z</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vx</td>
    <td>Vy</td>
    <td>Vz</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Wx</td>
    <td>Wy</td>
    <td>Wz</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p style="font-size:18px"><br>
The Second video shows be starting to calculate the cross product. But just the x at the moment:
</p>
<p style="font-size:16px">
The equation to calculate X for the resulting vector is:<br>
<em style="color:Red">VyWz</em> -<em style="color:blue">VzWy</em> <br>
You can notice here to calculate the x value you don't need to use <em>Vx or Wx</em> so you can use the table like this.

</p>
<table style="width:20%">
  <tr>
    <th>Y</th>
    <th>Z</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="color:Red">Vy</td>
    <td style="color:Blue">Vz</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="color:Blue">Wy</td>
    <td style="color:Red">Wz</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p style="font-size:16px">
You can also notice that <em style="color:red">VyWz</em> directly diagonal from each other when you ignore X and so is <em style="color:blue">VzWy</em> its is from the right to left. So you can x into different parts each going diagonal.<br> <em> Important: the second half is negative</em> <em style="color:blue">(-VzWy)</em>.<br> You can see this as because the diagonal is going right to left its therefore minus.
</p>

<p style="font-size:18px"> <br>The Third video shows me calculating Y similarly to X:</p>

<p style="font-size:16px">
The equation to calculate Y for the resulting vector is:<br>
<em>-</em>(<em style="color:Red">VxWz</em> - <em style="color:Blue">VzWx</em>)<br>

<p style="font-size:16px">
Again you don't need to use <em>Vy or Wy</em> like the previous section with X, so you can use the table like this.</p>

<table style="width:20%">
  <tr>
    <th>X</th>
    <th>Z</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="color:Red">Vx</td>
    <td style="color:blue">Vz</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="color:Blue">Wx</td>
    <td style="color:Red">Wz</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p style="font-size:16px">
<em style="color:red">VxWz</em> again are directly diagonal from each other when you ignore Y and so is <em style="color:blue">VzWx</em> its is from the right to left. So you can x into different parts each going diagonal.
<br><br>
<em> Important: the second half is negative</em>(<em style="color:blue"> -VzWx</em>).
<br> You can see this as because the diagonal is going right to left its therefore minus.
</p>

<p style="font-size:16px">
With the way I've shown calculating Y:<br><em>Important: You'll want to minus everything in the brackets.</em><br> I have shown it this way as you can keep the rule for going from top left to bottom right and vice versa

<p style="font-size:18px"> <br>The Forth video shows me calculating Z like both X and Y:</p>

<p style="font-size:16px">
The equation to calculate Y for the resulting vector is:<br>
<em style="color:red">VxWy</em> - <em style="color:blue">VyWx</em> <br>

<p style="font-size:16px">
Again you don't need to use <em>Vz or Wz</em> like the previous section with X and Y, so you can use the table like this.</p>

<table style="width:20%">
  <tr>
    <th>X</th>
    <th>Y</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="color:Red">Vx</td>
    <td style="color:Blue">Vy</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="color:Blue">Wx</td>
    <td style="color:Red">Wy</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p style="font-size:16px">
<em style="color:Red">VxWy</em> again are directly diagonal from each other when you ignore Y and so is <em style="color:Blue">VyWx</em> its is from the right to left. So you can x into different parts each going diagonal.
<br><br>
<em> Important: the second half is negative</em>(<em style="color:blue"> -VyWx</em>).
<br> You can see this as because the diagonal is going right to left its therefore minus.

<p style="font-size:18px"> <br>The Fifth video shows me putting everything together to give the final answer (including the long equation):</p>

<p style="font-size:16px">
Now for the final section. This is simply putting everything you've caculated up here all into one. You've calculated the new X, Y and Z vectors so all you need to do is put them together.
</p>
<p style="font-size:16px">
At the end you get the equation<br>
+ (<em style="color:Red">VyWz</em> -<em style="color:blue">VzWy</em>) for X<br>
<em>- </em>(<em style="color:Red">VxWz</em> - <em style="color:Blue">VzWx</em>) for Y<br>
+ (<em style="color:red">VxWy</em> - <em style="color:blue">VyWx</em>) for Z <br>
<br>
These is the resulting vector.
