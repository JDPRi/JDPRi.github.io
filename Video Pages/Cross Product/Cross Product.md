# Cross product explained

<p style="font-size:16px">
During one of my games concepts lectures there was a general confusion about what is happening in it. So I am going to have a brief cover over it.<br>
</p>

<p style="font-size:14px">
This is my first time doing anything like this so sorry if the quality isn't amazing.
</p>

<p style="font-size:18px">
In this first video I am briefly covering what the cross product is and how I'd start to write it out:
</p>

<p style="font-size:16px">
The idea here is to put the two vectors into a form that easy to see and understand. <br><br>Two vectors here V and W each with their own x, y and z co-ordinate, we're going to find the VxW, remember this is different to WxV. Where I have put them in the following form
</p>

<table style="width:20%">
  <tr>
    <th>X</th>
    <th>Y</th>
    <th>Z</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vx</td>
    <td>Vy</td>
    <td>Vz</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Wx</td>
    <td>Wy</td>
    <td>Wz</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The Second video shows be starting to calculate the cross product. But just the x at the moment:
</p>
<p style="font-size:16px">
The equation to calculate X for the resulting vector is:
<b>VyWz - VzWy</b> <br>
You can notice here to calculate the x value you don't need to use <b>Vx or Wx</b> so you can use the table like this.
</p>
<table style="width:20%">
  <tr>
    <th>Y</th>
    <th>Z</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vy</td>
    <td>Vz</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Wy</td>
    <td>Wz</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p style="font-size:16px">

You can also notice that <b>VyWz</b> directly diagonal from each other when you ignore X and so is <b>VzWy</b> its is from the right to left. So you can x into different parts each going diagonal.<br> <b> Important: the second half is negative (-VzWy).</b><br> You can see this as because the diagonal is going right to left its therefore minus.
