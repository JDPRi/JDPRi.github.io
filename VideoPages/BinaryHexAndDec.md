# Hexadecimal, Binary and Decimal

<p style="font-size:18px;color:lightblue">
Hello there! In this page I'm going to be going over hexadecimal, binary and decimal. Its a relatively easy topic but can be explained badly.

Decimal
</p>

So decimal is easy, you've been doing it since you were a kid. Its just your normal number system base 10. Meaning there are 10 possible numbers per unit. 0 through to 9.<br><br> As you go from right the left the value of the unit gets bigger by 10 each time due to it being base 10. And increases like:<br>1, 10, 100, 1000, etc <br>
Example: 205

Binary

Binary is a bit more complex but you'll also be fairly used to it. Its just your 1s and 0s that the computer used. The determine whether a transistor (The things that make up the computer) is on or off. It is base 2 meaning there can be 2 possible values, 0 and 1.<br><br>
A bit is a single binary unit, a byte is 8<br>
Bit: 0 or 1<br>
Byte: 1000100<br>
You can convert bits to decimal but I will go over that later.<br><br>
With binary being base 2 when you go from right to left the value gets bigger by x2 similar to decimal just with a different base so it increases differently.<br>
The first bit is 1 meaning it increases in the pattern.<br>
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128

Hexadecimal:

Hexadecimal is a bit of a inbetween for decimal and binary in my mind, it's easier for computers to work with than decimal but they'll still have to convert it to binary to use.<br>
And for us humans its easier to read than a long list of bytes.<br>
A hexadecimal number is base 16 meaning that it has 16 possible values, 0-9 is normal like a number, but then you use letters for the other 6 values A to F.<br><br>
Since a hex number is base 16. for each number it increases by x16 so the first value is  ${16^0 = 1}$ the second ${16^1=16}$ the third ${16^2= 256}$ etc
